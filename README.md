### Create a configuration file
Create a new php file in the config foler, for example "production.php". Copy the content for "example.php" (also in config folder) into your newly created file. Add or change al necessary config. Finally in the root directory you find a "mode.php". Edit the contents matching the name of your configuration file (no extension, only the name). If you have a "production.php" file you fill in "production".
